# Controls
`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` is implemented only partially and so will erase history after some operations  
`Left mouse button click` to select node  
Double `Left mouse button click` to toggle node's children  
`Shift + mouse wheel` to scroll horizontally  
Arrows left/right/up/down to navigate between children  
`+` to create child node and focus on it  
`Arrow right` to expand node that has its children collapsed

When a property is highlighted:
* Use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` to navigate to neighbour properties
* If it is checkbox or a button, hit `Space` to click it
* `Enter` to confirm changes and unhighlight property
* `Esc` to cancel changes (summary fields are bugged)
* `Ctrl` + arrow keys to ignore changing input cursor position and navigate between children instead
