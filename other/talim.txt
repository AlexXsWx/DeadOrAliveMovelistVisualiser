    WNC B:B is now +0  on block instead of -4
    3A      is now +2  on block instead of -2
    WNC K   is now -8  on block instead of -10
    1A+B    is now -12 on block instead of -16+
    BT B    is now -7  on block instead of -20
    WNC BB  is now -14 on block instead of -18

    6AK causes knockdown on normal hit
    6BB is now a NC and allows for followups
    WNS B no longer allows you to combo off it on airborne hit




--------------------



Talim's minus:
    3B:    -12 on block - can't dodge i12 low
    66A+B: -10 on block - can't dodge i12 low
    B:      -8 on block - can dodge i12 low with CE or 8K
    BK:     -6 on block - can dodge i12 low with CE
    4AK:    -4 on block - can dodge i12 low with 44B or jump
    A6:     -2 on block - can dodge i12 low with 4B+K
    K:       0 on neutral hit
    6AB:    +2 on block
    CE:     +4 on block
    A6:     +6 on neutral hit

A+B+K: 4
44B: 8
6B: 10
6B+K: 10
4B+K: 10
8G: 
66K: 12
A6: 14

K+G is 30...100 frames:
    from -12 you can land 6A (frame 30)
    from -12 you can't land 3B (frame 32)
    from +0 you can block    RE 6 {WS} {STD} 8K  (frame 101)
    from +0 you can't block  RE 6 {WS} {STD} 66B (frame 100)

BT CE is i18:

    3B      = -12 on block
    4B+K 34 = 46
    WF G 10 = 56
    WR K 39 = 95
              96 = block   - works

    FC A+B = -14 on block
    4B+K 34 = 48
    WF G 10 = 58
    WR K 39 = 97
              98 = block   - doesn't work
              
    B+K G = 30 =  30
    A+B G = 49 =  79
    CE = 17+1  = i97

the game has frame perfect precision:
    Azwel's AA is +0 on neutral hit
    Azwel's 1A is i34
    Sophitia's 1(K) is i35
    Azwel's 4B is i36

663214 is 44; 441236 is 66

turning from back to facing takes 5 frames (RE effect would appear on 6th frame)
GI is instant and lasts for 10 frames
buffered freestepping takes 11 frames
    ? "but apparently if you do 6(6)2A, you get 22A without having to sidestep
    dont even need to hold the 2nd 6 for long either, like, same amount of time you'd need to for 66A to work"

need to double check numbers:
    standing up is instant (RE effect appears instantly)
    RE doesn't work on moves that land 2-4 frames after activation, but iirc works on 6 frames

talim
    B is +0 on neutral hit
    K is +0 on neutral hit

    launchers:
        3B - universal; slow recovery; high crush

    6BB delay A+B (@Jaxel)
        A+B is free damage anyway; but if delayed can tech catch and ring out

    LH 236B ??? -> wind cannon

    {
        "tech trap" from @Jaxel:
        CH 4B,B into A+B catches techs and knocks them back
        6B,B*
    }

    wall splat soul charged 2_8 B+K, A A B B ~ 214 B is a true combo @Jeston

    LH A+B (GI):
        6(6) ~ {WNS} (K) ~ 4B (A) ~ {BT} B - 77 dmg; but requires timing to land
