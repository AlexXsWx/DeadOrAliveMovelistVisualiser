the game has frame perfect precision:
    Azwel's AA is +0 on neutral hit
    Azwel's 1A is i34
    Sophitia's 1(K) is i35
    Azwel's 4B is i36

663214 is 44; 441236 is 66

turning from back to facing takes 5 frames (RE effect would appear on 6th frame)
GI is instant and lasts for 10 frames
buffered freestepping takes 11 frames
    ? "but apparently if you do 6(6)2A, you get 22A without having to sidestep
    dont even need to hold the 2nd 6 for long either, like, same amount of time you'd need to for 66A to work"

need to double check numbers:
    standing up is instant (RE effect appears instantly)
    RE doesn't work on moves that land 2-4 frames after activation, but iirc works on 6 frames

talim
    B is +0 on neutral hit
    K is +0 on neutral hit

    launchers:
        3B - universal; slow recovery; high crush
        236B - very high & fast
        236(B) - very high & fast
        {WF} K - slow fall; stun
        {WC} B *B
        (6) K - FA
        (6) A+B - WC/WS/WF or slow recovery
        {CR} A+B
        {RE} B B - FA
        {JMP} B
        {SC} (6)A A A B

    juggles BNB:
        A A A+B
        {SC} (6)A A A B

    236B 6A+B
    66A+B 8 B*B
    66A+B 6 K B
    66A+B 6 (B) K | A+B
    {SC} {WS} (B) B B

    6BB delay A+B (@Jaxel)
        A+B is free damage anyway; but if delayed can tech catch and ring out

    LH 236B ??? -> wind cannon

    {
        "tech trap" from @Jaxel:
        CH 4B,B into A+B catches techs and knocks them back
        6B,B*
    }

    wall splat soul charged 2_8 B+K, A A B B ~ 214 B is a true combo @Jeston

    LH A+B (GI):
        6(6) ~ {WNS} (K) ~ 4B (A) ~ {BT} B - 77 dmg; but requires timing to land
