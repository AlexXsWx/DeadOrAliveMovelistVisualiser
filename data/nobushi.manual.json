// when the game shows killer info, it says direction for killer, not for you

forward+guard break in some cases will land where just guard break wouldn't
attacking from different direction than guarding does take extra time (at least after block / GB timeout)

block hit from guy w/o stamina to get free guaranteed GB

bleed is affected by stats?
you can't escape GB if your heavy attack (death rattle form 2/2) got parried

guard break
    if player A w/o stamina starts guard break, player B can start later and win because it will land faster
    you can't escape GB if
        if you dash forward
        if you whiffed GB
        you were doing light/heavy attack while got GB'ed by someone in revenge mode (or shugoki from his uninterruptible stance)
    you can escape GB when
        you're dodging with Hidden Stance
        you're idling in Hidden Stance
        you're in progress of changing guard direction (black mark on different spot than white)

blocking
    when outnumbered, blocking attack from locked opponent will for short time automatically block attacks from non-locked opponents

Landing hit with Death Rattle Form 1/2 can knock off the ledge


parry light -> attack light or attack heavy are both guaranteed
parry heavy -> attack heavy is not guaranteed

parry zone attack 1/2 - heavy is not guaranteed
parry zone attack 2/2 - light whiffs, heavy too slow
